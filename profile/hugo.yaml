    content: |
      I have collaborated with cheminformatics professors, mathematicians, statisticians, experimental scientists, AI experts, and even civil engineers. I have been a speaker at a few prestigious conferences. I love to work in a diverse and open workplace where creativity, diversity, and innovation are valued.

      I currently work as a Scientist at Gilead Sciences, and my research duties involve computational design of therapeutic proteins, including Antibodies, VHHs and immunization targets using AI ML methods I developed and industry standards. I have completed three degrees in life sciences including a Ph.D. degree in Computational Biology. Master's degree in Bioinformatics and a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and an industry postdoc at Prescient Design (Genentech Inc.).

      During my Ph.D. I have successfully conceptualized, initiated, designed, and implemented several novel and innovative ideas, carrying them out to successful completion that resulted in seven publications. I received the Research Excellence Award and graduation honor for it. I have also built a software package called PACKing and Motion Analysis (PACKMAN) around my research, which has tens of thousands of downloads on the Python Package Index (PyPI) (https://github.com/Pranavkhade/PACKMAN). The ultimate goal of my thesis has been to explain the global motions of the proteins using protein packing information, and I have made significant progress with this. Along with the research work, I have also completed various courses on diverse topics such as Structural Bioinformatics, Statistical Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics Algorithms, Systems Biology, and many more.

      During my Master's training, I learned more about Bioinformatics in Cell Biology, Immunology, Structural Biology, Genetics, Omics, Evolution, Cheminformatics, Data Mining, and Biostatistics. Overall, my Masters's degree included a detailed overview of Bioinformatics. I learned everything from predicting epitomes given viral protein sequences to relating Single Nucleotide Polymorphism to phenotypes. My Masters's research project was in Cheminformatics, where I designed a method to overcome the shortcomings of stochastic conformer generators.

        content: Biophysical Representation of Interfaces via Delaunay-based Graph Embeddings (BRIDGE), a coarse-grained graph neural network that captures embeddings containing meaningful information about protein-protein interactions. The BRIDGE model takes as input graphs defined by the Delaunay tesselation of the individual chains and is pre-trained to predict the Delaunay adjacency at the protein-protein interface. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in this task. The biophysical information captured by the BRIDGE embedding layer due to this pre-training task can further be used for downstream tasks, including for therapeutically relevant property prediction.

      - title: hdANM
        content: The motions predicted with this new elastic network model provide important conceptual advantages for understanding the underlying biological mechanisms. As a matter of fact, the generated hinge movements are found to resemble the expected mechanisms required for the biological functions of diverse proteins. Another advantage of this model is that the domain-level coarse graining makes it significantly more computationally efficient, enabling the generation of hinge motions within even the largest molecular assemblies, such as those from cryo-electron microscopy.

      - title: Protein Hinge Prediction
        content:  This was a fountation study before hdANM. This new method to identify hinges within protein structures is called PACKMAN. The predicted hinges are validated by using permutation tests on B-factors. Hinge prediction results are compared against lists of manually curated hinge residues, and the results suggest that PACKMAN is robust enough to reproduce the known conformational changes and is able to predict hinge regions equally well from either the open or the closed forms of a protein.

        content: This present study considers only elastic network models, but the approach could be applied further to conventional atomic molecular dynamics. Compliance is found to have a slightly better agreement with the experimental B-factors, perhaps reflecting its bias toward the effects of local perturbations, in contrast to mean square fluctuations.
